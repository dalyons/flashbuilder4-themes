h2. Non-Sucky themes for Flash Builder 4

This repo contains themes for Flash Builder 4 that dont sear the eyes like the default white.

I created it because it was impossible to find themes for Flash Builder 4 on the webs.

h2. Themes:

* Vibrant Ink - manully copied out from Rico's settings: http://ricozuniga.com/2009/11/24/vibrant-ink-theme-in-flex-builder-3/
* ZenBurnish - grab it from this cool cat: http://github.com/mnem/noiseandheat/tree/master/fb-zenburnish/

h2. Installation:

* Download whatever .epf file you want
* open Flash Builder, goto File->Import->General->Preferences
* choose the epf file, click 'import all' click finish
* restart Flash Builder
* party
